# Parts MCP Project

This project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for sourcing electronic parts with KiCad integration.

## Project Structure
- `/kicad` - KiCad integration modules
- `/docs` - Project documentation

## Development Guidelines
- When committing, use standard commit messages without attribution tags
- Focus on clear, descriptive commit messages that explain the changes
- Analyze the kicad-mcp project for understanding MCP patterns and KiCad integration approaches
- Build our own ground-up solution rather than extending existing implementations

## Reference Projects
- kicad-mcp: Analyze this project to understand MCP implementation patterns and KiCad integration techniques, but build our own solution from scratch
